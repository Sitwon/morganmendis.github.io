	<p>Welcome to my website, I have created this website to share my thoughts regading my passions and interests(<a href="https://morganmendis.github.io/aboutme">About Me</a>), which derive from either data that I have been able to collect or my experiences while traveling. In 2016, I plan to develop and share some interesting data products regarding public health and choosing a profession.</p>
